Interactive Audio Interface/Final project

For this project, I have use a collection of random sounds to create a gently annoying sound bot. To achieve this, I have created simple file structure consisting of index.html, style.css, and a script.js file. 

I have decided to keep the JavaScript file fairly uncomplicated, following a simple yet clean design I have created a function which shoots out circles following the colour scheme of the project. This was by far the most difficult part of this project, espetially considering I wanted this animation to be hearts (will perhaps improve later on). To connect the color pallette with the sounds I have used Document method querySelector(),to match the specified group of selectors.
